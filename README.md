# Cotton-Plant-Disease-Detector-Website-
"Cotton Plant Disease Detector Website" project help cotton farmers detect diseases in their plants using machine learning. The website provides a platform for farmers to upload images of their cotton plants and receive a diagnosis of any potential diseases and also give  some product recommendation.
The backend of the website used machine learning model trained on a dataset of cotton plant images to classify the uploaded images and provide a diagnosis to the user. The project also includes a frontend interface that allows users to interact with the website and view their diagnosis. Overall, this project aims to provide an accessible and efficient solution for detecting diseases in cotton plants, ultimately helping farmers to increase their crop yield and reduce economic losses.
